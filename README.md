UNCC BootCamp Homework 1 HTML-CSS

This HTML and CSS code was given to refactor the website by improving its long term sustainability and its accessibility. 

Changes to the website: 
  The link for “ Search Engine Optimization” at the header of the website wasn’t working. It was fixed. 
  A hover feature was added to the menu located to the right of the header. 
  A title was added to the website. 

Changes on accessibility: 
  On the HTML file the divs elements  were changed to semantic HTML elements. 
  Classes were deleted and the semantic elements were called from the CSS file. 
  The images were resized to fit the website requirements yet keep their quality. 
  Alt attributes were added to each of the images 
  A title was added to the new figure element.

Changes for Sustainability 
  Comments were added to the HTML and the CSS file. 
  The elements that modify the page without specificity were brought to the top of the CSS file. 
  The order of the elements and classes on the CSS file were called following the semantic structure of the HTML file.    
  Repeated selectors and properties were consolidated on the CSS file. 
  Some selectors and properties were unnecessary given the changes made to the code.
